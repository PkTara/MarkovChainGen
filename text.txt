Alia — 12/01/2025 09:49
I dont remember the exact thing but you were taught something about either powers or multiplication in modular arithmetic that would allow you to reduce the exponent and that should make things easier
Ed[ᶻz𐰁]
 — 12/01/2025 12:04
GCD(5, n) = 1 means that 5 does not divide n. Therefore, you have four possible cases for the remainder of n/5. The remainder is either 1, 2, 3 or 4. 

From there, you can consider each of the cases; the general strategy for each of the cases is to find a "loop" - that is, some n^x that has the remainder as some n^y.

I'll do the case of remainder=2. 

n =5= 2. 
n^2 =5= 2n =5= 4. 
n^3 =5= 4n =5= 8 =5= 3.
n^4 =5= 3n =5= 6 =5= 1.
n^5 =5= 1n =5= 2.


So now we have a loop between n^1 and n^5, since their remainders are both 2. Therefore we know n^9 will have the same remainder since applying *n 4 times to n^1 lead to the same remainder for n^5. And the same for n^13, n^17 etc.

n^2024 = n^2020 * n^4, and n^2020 is divisible by 4 (the length of our loop things). Hence n^2024 has the same remainder as n^4, which is 1.

You'll have to apply this to the 3 other remainder cases but you can get pretty fast at solving these kinds of problems! 

Also, you're guaranteed to find a loop in at most 5 operations since mod 5 only has 5 possible values (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) -> might actually be 4 because if something has remainder 0, then it sets the latter powers to 0. Since you don't get a calculator in 131 (and aren't taught more powerful techniques), you'll always get a fairly small number so this method is fine. 
mc — 12/01/2025 12:31
Wow, thank you very much.
I think the piece I was missing was using the fact that multiples of 5 are periodic so you can form that loop.

It's not overreliance, just that they aren't necessarily words (mine are numerical) so it would be unfair to count them as such.
